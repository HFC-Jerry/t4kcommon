      description: Tuxmath and Tuxtype are written in C and use the SDL library for graphics. The accessibility features will need to be integrated into the existing codebase and tested to ensure compatibility with the games. t4common is a shared library between Tuxmath and Tuxtype, so the accessibility features will need to be added inside it and new menu options will need to be added to the games to enable the features.
